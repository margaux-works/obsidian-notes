### 1. Jonas Schmedtmann approach

- always good to try to solve by ourselves but then we shouldn't be afraid to search for help
- Google, Stackoverflow, MDN web docs

### 2- Odin Project

1. Understand the problem:
	1. explain it in plain english
	2. explain it to someone else 
2. Plan
   - Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
- What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
- Whatâ€™s the desired output?
- Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
3. Pseudocode
4. Divide and conquer
	1. break it into sub problems and solve them one by one
	2. begin with the simpliest
	3. connect the dots
	4. "reduce the problem technique"

> **Stuck?** 
- debug: where is something going wrong
- reassess: take a step back. look at the problem from another perspective
- start new
- research
