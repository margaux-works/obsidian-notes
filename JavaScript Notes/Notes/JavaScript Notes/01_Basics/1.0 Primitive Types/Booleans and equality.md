**Booleans:** is a value of true or false, can be manually set or calculate:

  ```js
  //manually set
  let isDrawing = true;

  //calculate
  const age = 18;
  const ofAge = age > 19;
  console.log(ofAge); // result should be false
  ```

  **Equality:** we have:

  - = (setting or updating a variable)
  - == (it compares the value but not the type of )
  - === (compares the value and type of )

  ```js
  // =
  let dog = "Sharon";

  // ==
  "10" == 10; //result is true, it compares the value but not the type of (both values are 10)

  // ===
  "10" === 10; // result is false, compares value and type of (first one is string, second one is number)
  ```
